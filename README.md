# Simple Autoencoder Anomaly Detection
This is an unsupervised deep neural network trained to detect anomalies. The architecture of the neural network is an Autoencoder. This code is use for an undergraduate thesis titled "Detection of Suboptimal IMRT Treatment Plan using Machine Learning on Radiomics Features of Dose Distribution for Lung Cancers" which is part of a KBRT research in Department of Physics in University of Indonesia. The radiomics of dose distribution is used as both the input and output of the model. The data extraction process (radiomics calculation and converting DICOM to CSV) is done outside of this code. The raw data is not provided because it's a real medical record that is supposed to be private and for research purpose only. This model is trained on a very limited dataset (34 rows) but can be used for more. A code for statistics test of the data is provided as a complement.

Disclaimer: The result of the undergraduate thesis research is a null result, most likely due to the limited data set or a dirty input (radiomics features). Nevertheless, the result is still useful for further ML research in KBRT.
